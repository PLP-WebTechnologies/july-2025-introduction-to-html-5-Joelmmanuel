                    I just built my very first HTML web page through the Power Learn Academy, and I’m absolutely thrilled! It might be simple, but seeing my code come to life in a real browser felt like magic. Every line I wrote gave me more confidence, and now I’m even more motivated to keep learning and growing as a web developer. This is just the beginning—and it already feels powerful!
